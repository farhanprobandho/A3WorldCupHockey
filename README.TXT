PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project is designed to simulate the Group Stage of the 2024 World Hockey Championship.
VERSION or DATE: 03.22.24
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 1) Create an object of instance WorldCup, specifying the number of groups and the number of teams in every group. In our current version, we have support for a total of 20 teams.
                           2) Call the method hockeyCupSetup(), which sets up the championship by populating the groups with random teams. (Optional) Call the method display() to show the current groups, and all teams should have zero points.
                           3) Call the method randomGames(), which randomly simulates matches in every single group.
                           4) Call the method display() to view the standings and points at the end of the Group Stage. This method takes about 5-10 seconds.
